        "description": "[Jikan](https://jikan.moe) is an **Unofficial** MyAnimeList API.\nIt scrapes the website to satisfy the need for a complete API - which MyAnimeList lacks.\n\n# Information\n\n‚ö° Jikan is powered by its awesome backers - üôè [Become a backer](https://www.patreon.com/jikan)\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\n| Duration | Requests |\n|----|----|\n| Daily | **Unlimited** |\n| Per Minute | 60 requests |\n| Per Second | 3 requests |\n\nNote: It's still possible to get rate limited from MyAnimeList.net instead.\n\n\n## JSON Notes\n- Any property (except arrays or objects) whose value does not exist or is undetermined, will be `null`.\n- Any array or object property whose value does not exist or is undetermined, will be empty.\n- Any `score` property whose value does not exist or is undetermined, will be `0`.\n- All dates and timestamps are returned in [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format and in UTC timezone\n\n## Caching\nBy **CACHING**, we refer to the data parsed from MyAnimeList which is stored temporarily on our servers to provide better API performance.\n\nAll requests are cached for **24 hours**.\n\nThe following response headers will detail cache information.\n\n| Header | Remarks |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| `Expires` | Cache expiry date |\n| `Last-Modified` | Cache set date |\n| `X-Request-Fingerprint` | Unique request fingerprint (only for cachable requests, not queries) |\n\n\nNote: `X-Request-Fingerprint` will only be available on single resource requests and their child endpoints. e.g `/anime/1`, `/anime/1/relations`.\nThey won't be available on pages which perform queries, like /anime, or /top/anime, etc.\n\n## Allowed HTTP(s) requests\n\n**Jikan REST API does not provide authenticated requests for MyAnimeList.** This means you can not use it to update your anime/manga list.\nOnly GET requests are supported which return READ-ONLY data.\n\n## HTTP Responses\n\nAll error responses are accompanied by a JSON Error response.\n\n| Exception | HTTP Status | Remarks |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| N/A | `200 - OK` | The request was successful |\n| N/A | `304 - Not Modified` | You have the latest data (Cache Validation response) |\n| `BadRequestException`,`ValidationException` | `400 - Bad Request` | You've made an invalid request. Recheck documentation |\n| `BadResponseException` | `404 - Not Found` | The resource was not found or MyAnimeList responded with a `404` |\n| `BadRequestException` | `405 - Method Not Allowed` | Requested Method is not supported for resource. Only `GET` requests are allowed |\n| `RateLimitException` | `429 - Too Many Request` | You are being rate limited by Jikan or MyAnimeList is rate-limiting our servers (specified in the error response) |\n| `UpstreamException`,`ParserException`,etc. | `500 - Internal Server Error` | Something didn't work. Try again later. If you see an error response with a `report_url` URL, please click on it to open an auto-generated GitHub issue |\n| `ServiceUnavailableException` | `503 - Service Unavailable` | In most cases this is intentionally done if the service is down for maintenance. |\n\n## JSON Error Response\n\n```json\n {\n     \"status\": 500,\n     \"type\": \"InternalException\",\n     \"message\": \"Exception Message\",\n     \"error\": \"Exception Trace\",\n     \"report_url\": \"https://github.com...\"\n  }\n```\n\n| Property | Remarks |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| `status` | Returned HTTP Status Code |\n| `type` | Thrown Exception |\n| `message` | Human-readable error message |\n| `error` | Error response and trace from the API |\n| `report_url` | Clicking this would redirect you to a generated GitHub issue |\n\n\n## Cache Validation\n\n- All requests return a `ETag` header which is an MD5 hash of the response\n- You can use this hash to verify if there's new or updated content by suppliying it as the value for the `If-None-Match` in your next request header\n- You will get a HTTP `304 - Not Modified` response if the content has not changed\n- If the content has changed, you'll get a HTTP `200 - OK` response with the updated JSON response\n\n![Cache Validation](https://i.imgur.com/925ozVn.png 'Cache Validation')\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n- Jikan is not affiliated with MyAnimeList.net.\n- Jikan is a free, open-source API.
