# Configuration

## Basic

The connector reads `config.{json,yaml}` file in the configuration folder. The file contains information about the schema file path and its specification:

```yaml
files:
  - file: swagger.json
    spec: openapi2
  - file: openapi.yaml
    spec: openapi3
    trimPrefix: /v1
    envPrefix: PET_STORE
  - file: schema.json
    spec: ndc
```

The config of each element follows the [config schema](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-http/ndc-http-schema/blob/main/config.example.yaml) of `ndc-http-schema`.

You can add many API documentation files into the same connector.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Conflicted object and scalar types will be ignored. Only the type of the first file is kept in the schema.

## Supported specs

### OpenAPI

HTTP connector supports both OpenAPI 2 and 3 specifications.

- `oas3`/`openapi3`: OpenAPI 3.0/3.1.
- `oas2`/`openapi2`: OpenAPI 2.0.

### HTTP Connector schema

Enum: `ndc`

HTTP schema is the native configuration schema which other specs will be converted to behind the scene. The schema extends the NDC Specification with HTTP configuration and can be converted from other specs by the [NDC HTTP schema CLI](./ndc-http-schema).

## Timeout and retry

The global timeout and retry strategy can be configured in each file:

```yaml
files:
  - file: swagger.json
    spec: oas2
    timeout:
      value: 30
    retry:
      times:
        value: 1
      delay:
        # The default delay between each retry in milliseconds.
        # The connector prefers the Retry-After header in the response if exists
        value: 500
      httpStatus: [429, 500, 502, 503]
```

## JSON Patch

You can add JSON patches to extend API documentation files. HTTP connector supports `merge` and `json6902` strategies. JSON patches can be applied before or after the conversion from OpenAPI to HTTP schema configuration. It will be useful if you need to extend or fix some fields in the API documentation such as server URL.

```yaml
files:
  - file: openapi.yaml
    spec: oas3
    patchBefore:
      - path: patch-before.yaml
        strategy: merge
    patchAfter:
      - path: patch-after.yaml
        strategy: json6902
```

See [the example](./ndc-http-schema/command/testdata/patch) for more context.

## Runtime Settings

### Stringify JSON (boolean)

This setting treats the arbitrary JSON scalars as a JSON string. This setting is useful for some use cases, for example, making the schema compatible with PromptQL.
